# Slideshow with HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript

## Fetching images from the local JSON file

Here we have a slideshow with basic functionality, that can be played, paused, controlled with left and right arrows and also dot navigation.

We can add any number of images and the DOM will be updated dynamically with Javascript.
All we have to do is add the images (which have the same width and height) inside the images folder, and reference those files in the JSON object inside **slideshow.json** file.

We can change the delay of the slideshow by changing the value of the variable `let delay = 3000;` in the Javascript file.
